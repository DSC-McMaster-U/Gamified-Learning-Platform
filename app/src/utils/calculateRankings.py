# calculateRankings.py - uses certain algorithms and data structures to sort and organize member points in the order to be displayed on the leaderboard
# None of this ever ended up getting used... rip :(

"""
Plan:
    - Query from database a custom table containing user name, user's username, and points for when Points.user_id == User.id; users can be filtered from a specific course,
      or everyone can just be given at once.
    - Maybe find some way to locally store that data somehow in records (also needs efficient fetch; may not require an ordered structure)?
    - Use a balanced binary (red-black) tree to sort users by points; the keys will be the points, while the values will be lists containing (references to?) people with
      those number of points.

Usage of the main Leaderboard class (export just this class from the file):
    - Leaderboard(courseID: optional int): 
        Instantiates a new leaderboard object out of a query of all users in the database, based on their points. If an integer course ID is provided, then the query is
        limited to users enrolled within that specific course. Once all users are obtained from the query, the leaderboard automatically calculates every user's rankings,
        based off of their associated points in the database. For multiple users with the same points, they are all considered under the same rank number N, while the user(s)
        with the next rank is simply placed at rank number (N + 1). 

    - Leaderboard.updateData():
        Updates the given leaderboard object with a new query of all database users, or a new one with all users within a specific course (if the leaderboard was created
        with a course ID integer). Users added to the database will be added to the rankings, while users deleted from the database will be removed from the rankings with
        the rankings adjusted accordingly. Users whose points data is changed (e.g. `userA` points rise from 57 -> 83; `userB` points fall from 69 -> 42) will also be 
        altered accordingly within the leaderboard.

        (...One possible oversight in this update function is if the user's name is somehow changed, since the queries only filter by username and points; therefore, 
        the leaderboard won't contain updated information on that specific user's name. Support should be added within the query comparisons if such a feature is added
        in the future.)
    
    - Leaderboard.getBottomRankNum() -> int:
        Returns the rank of the user(s) with the least amount of points on the leaderboard.

    - Leaderboard.getUsersByRank(rank: int) -> list[dict]:
        Given a specific rank integer (where rank >= 1 and rank <= Leaderboard.getBottomRankNum()), returns a list containing the information of 1 or more users placed
        at that rank. If a number outside of the above range is provided, then a UserDBError exception is thrown.
    
    - Leaderboard.getRankByUser(username: str) -> int:
        Given the username of a user within the leaderboard, returns an integer corresponding to the rank of the provided user. If no user exists with the given username,
        a UserDoesNotExistError exception is thrown.

    - Leaderboard.getTopUsers() -> list[dict]:    
        Returns a list of the user(s) ranked the highest on the leaderboard (most amount of points).

    - Leaderboard.getBottomUsers() -> list[dict]:   
        Returns a list of the user(s) ranked the lowest on the leaderboard (least amount of points).

    - Leaderboard.getAllUsers() -> dict:
        Returns a dictionary with keys corresponding to rank numbers and values representing a list of users corresponding with 
        each rank. The structure is as follows:
            {
                <rank #>: [
                    {
                        "name": <user's name>,
                        "username": <user's username>,
                        "points": <user's point count>
                    }
                ]
            }

    - Leaderboard.getUsersByRankRange(topRank: int, bottomRank: int) -> dict:
        Returns a dictionary in the same format above from Leaderboard.getAllUsers(), but instead limited to users from topRank up to bottomRank (inclusive).
        Note that the arguments must be passed such that topRank is smaller than bottomRank, topRank & bottomRank are at least 1, and topRank & bottomRank are less than
        or equal to the rank of the user with the least amount of points (to check, use Leaderboard.getBottomRankNum() to get this rank number).

This is the main class other programs will interact with for the leaderboard. Ideally, this should be a group of functions 
interacting with the Leaderboard DB schema, instead of a large class storing data, but Mithun (who's in charge of creating that schema) hasn't gotten 
back to me yet on how he's designing it... for now, this is a temporary solution until he finishes his tasks and uploads a PR.
"""
class Leaderboard():
    """
    A class used to store and fetch the rankings of users within the entire database or within a specified Class database entry (if passed a courseID int during instantiation).

    The leaderboard is constructed into two primary parts: the rankings, and userInfo. The userInfo stores all relevant user info 
    within a special Node class of sorts (UserEntryNode), and each of these UserEntryNodes are stored within a hash table such that the 
    information is accessible by indexing with a user's unique username within O(1) average time. Rankings, on the other hand, is structured 
    as a red-black tree (where PointsTree = outer "container" class pointing to root, and PointsNode = individual tree nodes storing user points 
    as a key and 1 or more reference(s) to users/UserEntryNodes with those points). To find a user's ranking, we would need to get their 
    relevant points info using their username, then find its relevant PointsNode in the rankings R-B tree and determine their rank based 
    on the PointsNode's overall position in the structure.

    For updating the leaderboard, there is no need to manually append any sort of user to the leaderboard; instead, just
    change whatever relevant data within the database itself. By running Leaderboard.updateData(), the leaderboard will
    query the db and make any necessary additions or deletions to its data. Other methods also exist to obtain users or rank numbers in
    a variety of ways, such as filtering users by rank number, getting a user's rank given their username, getting top or bottom users in 
    the leaderboard, getting users within a range of ranks, and getting all users with their ranks in the leaderboard.
